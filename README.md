# bitmex-test-app

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
### Because BitMEX does not allow by default access to their API with browsers (by not sending CORS headers), you need to find a suitable CORS proxy or run one yourself. If you have the source code of this project, you can run one by running this in a separate terminal window.
### It will listen on port 8081 and settings are pre-filled with this proxy address.
```
npm run proxy
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
